            ## Frontend-Only Pack

            This version of pack-league is frontend-only (no daemon binary required).
            The main Clip Companion daemon handles game detection and system integration.

            ### Changes
            - Migrated to @companion/pack-protocol
            - Added TypeScript Live Client API client
            - Removed Rust daemon (now frontend-only)
